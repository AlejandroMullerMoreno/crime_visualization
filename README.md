This is a data engineering project that aims at visualizing the differences in statistics related to crime for a major American city (Los Angeles) through a roughly 50 year span.

The crime data will be used to compare the rate of reporting of crime in the city of Los Angeles. Through this, we will seek to note whether the rate of crime and the rate of reporting positively correlate or not, and what implications we might be able to draw from this.
